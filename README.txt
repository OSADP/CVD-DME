BSMDE Measures Estimation Overview
============================
This software package contains code to estimate key transportation measures using connected vehicle messages as well as to establish ground truth data using vehicle trajectories. The software estimates seven transportation measures: Queues at Known Locations, Queues at Unknown Locations, Cycle Failure, Shockwaves, Travel Time, Delay and Space Mean Speed. Programs are used for both collecting Ground Truth data from vehicle trajectories and for estimating the measures using connected vehicle messages. Measures estimation can be performed using any type of message provided it has basic key elements as detailed in the user guide.

Configuration
-------------------------
The BSMDE Measures Estimation software can run on most standard Window or Linux based computers with 
Pentium core processers, with at least two gigabits of RAM and at least 100 MB of drive space.
Performance of the software will be based on the computing power and available RAM in 
the system.  Larger datasets can require much larger space requirements depending on the 
amount of data being read into the software.

The BSMDE Measures Estimation software application was developed using the open source
programming language Python 2.7 (www.python.org). The application requires Python 2.7
or higher to run.

The application can be run on Windows, Linux, or Mac operating systems. Python is installed
by default on many Linux and Mac operating systems.


Documentation
-------------

The BSMDE Measures Estimation software is packaged with Word based User Guides
"The Measures Estimation software User manual.docx" and "The Ground Truth software User manual.docx" that contain all information about background
purpose, benefits, objectives, inputs/outputs, how to run the software and requirements for the software.
